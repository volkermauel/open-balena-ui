# User Interface for Open Balena Admin

User interface for [open-balena-admin](https://github.com/dcaputo-harmoni/open-balena-admin), an admin interface for
open-balena.

## Dependencies

This project is dependent on [open-balena-postgrest](https://github.com/dcaputo-harmoni/open-balena-postgrest) and
[open-balena-remote](https://github.com/dcaputo-harmoni/open-balena-remote), so the easiest way to get this up and
running would be to install it via the [open-balena-admin](https://github.com/dcaputo-harmoni/open-balena-admin)
project.

## Configuration

There are a number of environment variables used to configure the ui:

- `PORT` - The port that the ui will listen on

- `REACT_APP_OPEN_BALENA_POSTGREST_URL` The URL (accessible to API) of the `open-balena-postgrest` instance, i.e.
  `http://postgrest.openbalena.local:8000`

- `REACT_APP_OPEN_BALENA_REMOTE_URL` The URL (accessible to API) of the `open-balena-remote` instance, i.e.
  `http://remote.openbalena.local:10000`

- `REACT_APP_OPEN_BALENA_API_URL` The URL (accessible to API) of the `open-balena-api` instance, i.e.
  `https://api.openbalena.local`

- `REACT_APP_OPEN_BALENA_API_VERSION` The version of `open-balena-api` that the above instance is running, i.e.
  `v0.139.0`

- `REACT_APP_BANNER_IMAGE` The URL of a custom banner image to use on the main dashboard.

These variables can be supplied through the standard Vite `.env` files (for example `.env`, `.env.local`, or
`.env.<mode>` when invoking `vite --mode <mode>`). The active mode is already set for the provided `npm run dev` and
`npm run dev:local` scripts.

### Supervisor updates

Two additional server-side variables configure the supervisor version management feature:

- `BALENACLOUD_TOKEN` A balenaCloud JWT (any account, e.g. a free one) used to pull supervisor images from
  `registry2.balena-cloud.com` when mirroring them into your instance registry. **Optional**: without it, version
  listing still works, but seeding/updating to a version that is not yet mirrored fails with a clear notice in the ui.
- `OPEN_BALENA_REGISTRY_URL` The base URL of your instance registry, e.g. `https://registry2.openbalena.local`.
  **Optional**: defaults to deriving the registry host from `REACT_APP_OPEN_BALENA_API_URL` by replacing the leftmost
  host label with `registry2` (`api.openbalena.local` → `registry2.openbalena.local`).
- `BALENACLOUD_API_URL` Base URL of the balenaCloud API used for the public supervisor catalog. **Optional**, defaults
  to `https://api.balena-cloud.com`.

## Supervisor Version Management

openBalena ships without any supervisor releases, so devices keep the supervisor that was baked into the flashed OS
image. This ui adds a one-click supervisor update:

- The **device dashboard** shows the current and any pending target supervisor version and offers an "Update Supervisor"
  dialog listing the available versions for the device's CPU architecture (sourced from balenaCloud's public supervisor
  catalog, deduplicated and ordered newest-first). Versions older than the device's current one are listed but disabled
  — open-balena-api rejects supervisor downgrades.
- The **device list** offers a bulk action for the selected devices (they must share one device type), and the **fleet
  edit page** can update every device of a fleet (grouped by device type).

On first use of a version, the ui server seeds it into your instance: it creates the public
`balena_os/<arch>-supervisor` application, services and image metadata with your own user credentials, copies the image
bytes byte-identically (by manifest digest, config and layers included) from balenaCloud's registry into your instance
registry, and only then creates the `success` release. Afterwards it sets each device's target supervisor release
(`should be managed by-release`) with your credentials; the instance API enforces the no-downgrade rule per device and
the ui reports per-device results.

All `/supervisor-releases/*` endpoints of the ui server require a valid ui JWT; instance writes always run with the
calling user's token. Validate on a real device before rolling a whole fleet.

## Exposing Device Connection Endpoints

Each device has a "Connect" button which uses balena image labels to discover available services on that device. To make
use of this auto-discovery, you will need to add tags to each container within your balena application's
`docker-compose` file where you would like to expose services. Examples of the three types of services available to
expose are provided below (http, https and vnc); note that ssh services are enabled by default and do not need labels.
When a device is running an application that exposes container services using the label constructs below, you will see
the service appear in the list of available connections for that container when clicking the "Connect" button for that
device in the admin ui.

HTTP Services:

```sh
    labels:
      openbalena.remote.http: '1'
      openbalena.remote.http.port: '5003'
      openbalena.remote.http.path: '/'
```

HTTPS Services:

```sh
    labels:
      openbalena.remote.https: '1'
      openbalena.remote.https.port: '1880'
      openbalena.remote.https.path: '/nr-admin'
```

VNC Services:

```sh
    labels:
      openbalena.remote.vnc: '1'
      openbalena.remote.vnc.port: '5900'
```

**Note**: The port specified above is a host container port, so the service needs to be mapped to a host port matching
the port specified in the label in your `docker-compose` file.

## Dashboard URL Routes

`open-balena-ui` includes routes that conform to the standard balena convention that you will see when running
`balena devices` using `balena-cli`. Specifically, if you point your browser to your `open-balena-ui` server with a path
of `/devices/<UUID>/summary`, it will redirect you to the dashboard for that device. If you point the
`dashboard.yourdomain.com` host to your `open-balena-ui` instance, the URL should conform to the standard balena
convention.

## Compatibility

This project is compatible with `open-balena-api` v0.139.0 or newer, all the way up to the current builds (v0.190.0).
See [this project](https://github.com/dcaputo-harmoni/open-balena-helm) for a fork of bartversluijs' open-balena-helm
project which has helm scripts to build a current version of `open-balena`.

## Installation

Ensure you are running Node.js 24 or newer locally to match the production image and CI configuration.

Set the required environment variables accordingly, and run `npm run start` from the main project folder. If running
locally, you can access `open-balena-ui` via your web browser at `http://localhost:PORT`, and provided the configuration
environment variables are appropriately pointed to live `open-balena-api` and `open-balena-postgrest` instances, you
should be up and running.

## Development

For local development, the Vite dev server exposes two modes:

- `npm run dev` launches with the `devprod` mode configuration (mirroring hosted settings).
- `npm run dev:local` loads the `local` mode configuration for working against local services.

When you need a production-like client build, run `npm run build:client` (or `npm run build` to bundle both client and
server) followed by `npm run serve` to boot the compiled Express server.

## Credits

- The [ra-data-postgrest](https://github.com/raphiniert-com/ra-data-postgrest) project was instrumental in establishing
  the link to the open-balena database

## Legacy Items

- **Expanded Vite config**: The configuration keeps legacy behavior from the original webpack/CRA setup—explicit aliases
  and polyfills for the Node-style modules above, plus tailored build/preview settings so the Express server can serve
  the SPA exactly as before.
